Legal TLDR: Treat My Inventory like a commercial product you license through the Unity Asset Store on purchase.

 •	My Inventory is not open source.
 • 	You may not sell, publish or distribute the source code or any modifications thereof in any circumstance.
 •	You may not distribute the code in open-source projects or asset store plugins.
 •	You may not port the source code to other engines and release it.

 •	You may use My Inventory in projects developed in Unity, both commercial and non-commercial.

 • 	It's not enforced, but I would be really happy if you would credit me for My Inventory in your project!
